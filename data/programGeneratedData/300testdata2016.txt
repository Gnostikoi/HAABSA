– this review is for the southglen location which is not listed in citysearch : i wish this review would make $T$ enough for it to be addressed by management but snooze has people climbing over each other for a chance to eat at this overpriced restaurant with mediocre food and service , so this review as well as the other negative ones for their larimer location will go unaddressed .
